# hmpps-e-surveillance-data

This repository contains synthetic data for use in the development and testing of the Technology for Community Offender Management (TICOM) Pathfinder project.

Note that *all* data in this repository is synthetic - that is to say, artificially generated. Any similarity to persons living or dead is purely coincidental.
